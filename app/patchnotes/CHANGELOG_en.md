## 🆕 Version 2.5.1

### 🆕 New Feature: Giant Tracker
Standalone window in the Killfeed plugin — captures and visualizes kill statistics for **Giants**, **Violets**, and **Bosses**.

**Filter Tabs**
- 5 tabs: **All** · **Giants** · **Violets** · **Bosses** · **Drops**
- **Bosses** — filters by rank `boss` (red card border, dedicated icon styling)
- **Drops** — shows only monsters with logged drops, including loot pool preview (top 5 items by rarity) directly on the card

**Kill Statistics**
- Card view with Compact and Expanded mode
- Time ranges: Today, Week, Month, Year, Total
- Monster info: Icon, Name, Level, Element, Rank, HP, ATK

**Drop Tracking**
- Log drops from the monster's loot pool (with rarity filter)
- Drop history per monster: Item name, kill counter state, timestamp
- Statistics: Avg. kills/drop, kills since last drop

**Time to Kill (TTK)**
- Automatically measures combat duration against Giants, Violets, and Bosses
- 10s grace period when deselecting the target (buffing, healing, etc.) — pause time is not counted toward TTK
- Monster name + max HP fingerprint: target is reliably recognized again
- Display: Last TTK, Avg. TTK, Fastest
- Persisted in kill history (CSV column `TTK_ms`)

**Other**
- Sorting by kills, name, or level
- Search field to filter by monster name

### ✨ Additional Improvements
- Killfeed: Improved monster detection
- New identification weighting: Monster HP > Monster Level > Monster Element
- Killfeed: Monster tracking now counts killed mobs
- Killfeed: History introduced (per profile)
  - Daily file per date with individual kills (`Date/Time`, `Character`, `Level`, `Monster-ID`, `Rank`, `Monster`, `Element`, `EXP Gain`, `Expected EXP`, `TTK_ms`)
  - Aggregated daily summary with `Kills`, `Total EXP`, `Monster Distribution`, `First/Last Kill`
- Killfeed: Monster tracking in the sidepanel now updates immediately after kills (no tab switch required)
- Killfeed: In the monster-tracking accordions, each rank now has a Kills button with a ListView of individual kills.
  Individual kills can be deleted directly in the ListView.
  When deleting individual kills, AppData history files (daily/YYYY-MM-DD.csv, history.csv) and sidepanel state are updated.
- Killfeed: Sidepanel now follows the overlay target profile reliably (no jumping between profile IDs)
- Monster reference data updated
- "Select layout" dialog design optimized
- "Manage profiles (log out)" dialog design optimized

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Overlays no longer overlap the close dialog
- Accordions in the documentation are displayed correctly
- Migration from version 2.3.0 to the new AppData structure (`user/`) now runs reliably
- Killfeed: Negative OCR EXP jumps are now filtered as OCR noise and no longer distort kill detection

### 🧹 Cleanup
- Renderer architecture modularized (internal restructuring)
- Internal data folder `api_fetch/` renamed to `cache/`
- AppData directory structure reorganized: data is now sorted in the AppData\Roaming\Flyff-U-Launcher\user subfolder
- Automatic migration: existing data is migrated seamlessly on first launch — with progress indicator
- Static data (including reference data) is bundled in the build so it is reliably available in release builds
- Killfeed/overlay debug logging reduced to keep the console easier to read
